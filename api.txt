API(Application Programming Interface):
---------------------------------------
set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that we can use
to create S/W or interact with an extrenal system.

Endpoint:
---------
It is a URL or URI(Uniform Resorce Identifier) that an API exposes to allow
communication with other S/W.

It represent a specific function or resource in a web service.

When u make a request to an API, u typically use the API endpoint to
specify the operation u want to perform or the data u want to retrieve.

API Path/ Params:
------------------

To get specific data:


api-endpoint/path

api-endpoint/path?contains=params
api-endpoint/path?contains=params1&type=params2

contains and type are keys and params are value.

API Authentication:
-------------------

To check how often a specific user is using an api.

Every user have a secret and particular key

api-endpoint?appid=key


Postman:
--------
Testing an API with browser is very difficult when
number of params increases.

Therefore we use Postman application.

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation):
---------------------------------

In JS:
------
var obj = {
    doors: 2,
    color: "red"
}
